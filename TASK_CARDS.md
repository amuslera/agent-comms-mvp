- Owner: CA
- Branch: cli/plan-templates-TASK-150G
- Description: Added reusable MCP-compliant YAML plan templates and integrated them into the bluelabel new-plan command.
- Implementation:
  - Created three plan templates in /plans/templates/:
    - basic-single-agent.yaml
    - multi-agent-dag.yaml
    - approval-gated-flow.yaml
  - Extended CLI (cli_runner.py) with new-plan command and --template flag
  - new-plan copies the selected template to /plans/<name>.yaml and prompts user to edit
  - All templates pass bluelabel lint and include required fields (task_id, agent, input, parameters, requires, approval)
- Files Added:
  - /plans/templates/basic-single-agent.yaml
  - /plans/templates/multi-agent-dag.yaml
  - /plans/templates/approval-gated-flow.yaml
- Files Modified:
  - /tools/cli/cli_runner.py
  - /TASK_CARDS.md
  - /postbox/CA/outbox.json
- Testing: All templates validated with bluelabel lint
- Notes: CLI now supports rapid plan creation from reusable templates

### TASK-150H: YAML Plan Dry-Run Execution Preview
- Status: ✅ Done
- Owner: CA
- Branch: cli/plan-dry-run-TASK-150H
- Description: Added --dry-run and --summary flags to bluelabel run for previewing YAML plan execution order, DAG structure, agent routing, and approvals without running tasks.
- Implementation:
  - --dry-run: Shows ordered execution plan, DAG layers, agent routing, approvals/blockers
  - --summary: One-liner per task (task_id, agent, type, deps, approval)
  - No agent execution occurs in dry-run mode
  - Both flags can be combined for compact preview
- Edge Cases Tested:
  - Linear, parallel, and diamond-shaped DAGs
  - Cycles and missing dependencies flagged
  - Approval-gated and multi-agent plans
- Files Modified:
  - /tools/cli/cli_runner.py
  - /TASK_CARDS.md
  - /postbox/CA/outbox.json
- Testing: CLI outputs validated for all templates and sample plans
- Notes: CLI now supports safe debugging and preview of plan execution

### TASK-150C: MCP Schema Compliance Fix
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Owner**: CC
**Branch**: core/mcp-schema-fix-TASK-150C
**Description**: Improved and enforced MCP schema compliance in plan execution with strict validation.
**Details**:
- Created comprehensive MCPSchemaValidator class in `/core/mcp_schema.py`
- Fixed incorrect message type in plan_runner.py (was "task_result", now "task_assignment")
- Added strict validation for all required fields: agent, task_id, action, parameters, etc.
- Implemented clear error messages with field-specific details and suggestions
- Created TASK_ASSIGNMENT_SCHEMA.json for proper task assignment validation
- Added `bluelabel schema-check` CLI command for plan and message validation
**Schema Issues Found**:
- plan_runner was using wrong message type ("task_result" instead of "task_assignment")
- No validation for required fields like agent, task_id, action
- Missing enum validation for agents, priorities, task types
- No format validation for task_id (uppercase alphanumeric)
- No dependency validation (checking if referenced tasks exist)
**Fixes Implemented**:
- ✅ Strict field validation with helpful error messages
- ✅ Enum validation for agents (CA, CC, WA), priorities, task types
- ✅ Format validation for task_id, protocol_version, timestamps
- ✅ Dependency existence and circular dependency checks
- ✅ Separate schemas for task assignments vs results
- ✅ CLI tool with auto-detection of file types
**Files**:
- `/core/mcp_schema.py` - Comprehensive MCP validator module
- `/schemas/TASK_ASSIGNMENT_SCHEMA.json` - New schema for task assignments
- `/tools/arch/plan_runner.py` - Updated to use correct message type and validation
- `/tools/cli/schema_checker.py` - CLI tool for validation
- `/bluelabel` - Main CLI entry point with schema-check command
- `/tools/cli/lint_utils.py` - Fixed f-string syntax error
**CLI Examples**:
```bash
# Check a plan file
bluelabel schema-check plans/my-plan.yaml

# Check with verbose output
bluelabel schema-check plans/my-plan.yaml --verbose

# Check a message file
bluelabel schema-check postbox/CC/outbox.json --type message
```
**Testing**: Validated with edge cases including invalid agents, missing fields, format violations
