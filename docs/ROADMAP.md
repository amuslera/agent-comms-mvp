- Fallback agent routing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### âœ… Phase 4: Documentation & Testing
- Comprehensive architectural documentation
- End-to-end test frameworks
- Execution flow diagrams
- API reference documentation
- System overview and release notes

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: UI & Visualization (In Progress)
- Terminal-based dashboards âœ…
- React UI shell for web interface âœ…
- FastAPI backend endpoints âœ…
- Web-based monitoring (partial)
- Visual task orchestration (planned)

## In Progress

## Phase 6 Preview: Advanced Features

The next major phase will focus on extending the platform capabilities:

### Webhooks & Integrations
- External service triggers
- Notification delivery
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Event subscription system
- Custom callback endpoints

### Observability & Metrics
- Prometheus metrics exposure
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Performance tracing
- Resource utilization monitoring
- SLO/SLA tracking

### Postbox-to-API Migration
- Gradual replacement of file-based messaging
- RESTful API communication layer
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Message persistence in database
- Pagination and filtering for large message volumes

### Automation Enhancements
- Pipeline templates
- Scheduled task execution
- Conditional execution paths
- Parameterized workflows
- Version control integration

## Long-Term Vision

Our vision for Bluelabel Agent OS is to become a self-orchestrating agent platform that enables:

1. **Autonomous Agent Collaboration** - Agents negotiate and collaborate on complex tasks without central coordination
2. **Dynamic Task Allocation** - Intelligent routing of tasks based on agent capabilities and performance
3. **Continuous Learning** - System improves over time by analyzing execution patterns and outcomes
4. **Human-Agent Collaboration** - Seamless interaction between human operators and autonomous agents
5. **Cross-Organization Workflows** - Secure collaboration across organizational boundaries

## Timeline Projections

| Phase | Timeline | Target Completion |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Phase 5: UI & Visualization | Current | Q3 2025 |
| Phase 6: Advanced Features | 3-6 months | Q1 2026 |
| Phase 7: Distributed Systems | 6-9 months | Q3 2026 |
| Phase 8: AI Enhancement | 9-12 months | Q1 2027 |
