### Local Branches Review

All local feature branches for TASK-060 through TASK-090 were reviewed:
- Total branches checked: 21
- Unmerged commits found: 0
- All work has been successfully integrated into main

### Branches Excluded from Review (Per TASK-130M Scope)

The following were excluded due to active WA refactoring:
- feat/TASK-060E-dag-viewer (WA task)
- feat/TASK-076A-dag-viewer-repair (UI related)
- feat/TASK-110C-ui-polish-sprint (UI sprint)
- Any branches modifying apps/web/

### Recommendations

1. **Delete remote branches**: All 6 remote branches listed above can be safely deleted
2. **Delete local branches**: All local branches with 0 unmerged commits can be cleaned up
3. **Preserve**: Keep any WA/UI branches until TASK-120R refactor is complete

### Cleanup Commands

```bash
git push origin --delete feat/TASK-061B-architecture-docs

# ... etc for all branches with 0 unmerged commits
```
