# Phase 6.9 Postmortem: System Stability & Task Integrity

## ✅ Summary of Achievements
- Refactored and validated UI metrics page (`/metrics`)
- Verified all CLI commands and YAML plan tooling
- Executed end-to-end plan with agent routing and DAG-based logging
- Rebuilt and cleaned `/TASK_CARDS.md` metadata

## 🧠 Key Findings by Agent

### CC – End-to-End Execution (TASK-140C)
- ❌ No automatic branch creation per task
- ❌ No automatic updates to `/TASK_CARDS.md`
- ⚠️ MCP schema compliance issues in enhanced plan runner
- ⚠️ No observable agent response processing loop
- ✅ DAG metadata and inbox dispatch validated

### CA – CLI & YAML Plan Validation (TASK-140A)
- ✅ CLI infrastructure solid (run, lint, report, new-plan, test-all)
- ✅ Linter correctly flagged schema errors
- ⚠️ Suggestion: Improve CLI error messages and add fix hints
- ⚠️ Could add `bluelabel dry-run` as a CLI execution preview

## 🚨 Carry-Forward Gaps for Phase 6.10
- [ ] `TASK-150A`: Auto-branch creation per YAML plan task
- [ ] `TASK-150B`: Agent-side `/TASK_CARDS.md` update utility
- [ ] `TASK-150C`: MCP schema validation + fix in plan runner
- [ ] `TASK-150D`: Agent response lifecycle handler
- [ ] `TASK-150E`: CLI lint output improvements (clarity, hints)

## 🏷️ Tag Summary
- All validated tasks merged and tagged as `v0.6.9`
- Full tracking in `/SPRINT_HISTORY.md` and agent outboxes
