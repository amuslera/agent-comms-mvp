# Release Notes - v1.4.1 Test Verified

## Project Purpose

The Agent Communication System (Agent OS) is a foundational infrastructure for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration through file-based message passing. This system enables autonomous agents to communicate, coordinate tasks, and execute workflows in a distributed environment.

## v1.4.1 - Live Test Verification

This patch release confirms the successful testing and verification of the retry/fallback functionality introduced in v1.4.0 through comprehensive live testing.

### What's New in v1.4.1

#### Live Test Execution
- Created and executed `plans/live_test_plan.yaml` with intentional failure scenarios
- Verified retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts for CA agent)
- Confirmed automatic fallback routing from CA to CC after retry exhaustion
- Validated dependency chain execution after successful fallback

#### Test Results Summary
- **Total Events**: 19 logged events
- **Retry Events**: 2 (as designed)
- **Fallback Events**: 1 (CA → CC fallback)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all tasks eventually completed)
- **Test Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Test Artifacts Created
1. `/tools/test_retry_fallback.py` - Test runner script for simulation
2. `/logs/retry_fallback_test.log` - Detailed event log with timestamps
3. `/logs/TASK-043B-test-report.md` - Comprehensive test analysis

### Key Verification Points
- Retry mechanism triggers correctly after task failures
- Exponential backoff is applied between retry attempts
- Fallback agent selection works as configured
- Dependent tasks wait for upstream completion
- All events are properly logged for audit trail

- CC (Claude Code): Test execution and live monitoring
- CA (Cursor AI): Test plan design and validation
- WA (Web Assistant): Test summary and reporting
- ARCH: Test coordination and verification

## v1.4.0 - Phase 4 Sprint 1: Resilient Orchestration

This milestone introduces critical improvements to system reliability through retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and enhanced orchestration capabilities.

### New Features

#### 1. Retry and Fallback Mechanisms
- **Automatic Retry**: Tasks can now be retried with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Agents**: Failed tasks can be rerouted to alternative agents
- **Configurable Attempts**: Set max_retries per task in execution plans
- **Enhanced Error Tracking**: Detailed retry history and failure analysis

#### 2. Execution Plan Enhancements
```yaml
tasks:
  - id: task-1
    agent: WA
    max_retries: 3        # Will attempt up to 3 times
    fallback_agent: CC    # Route to CC if WA fails
    dependencies: []
```

#### 3. CLI Tools
- **generate_execution_summary.py**: New tool for generating execution reports
  - Parses orchestrator logs for insights
  - Supports markdown, JSON, and terminal output
  - Provides completion statistics and error summaries

#### 4. Documentation Improvements
- **ARCH_PROTOCOL.md**: Comprehensive orchestration protocol documentation
- **retry_fallback_guide.md**: Complete guide to retry and fallback patterns
- Enhanced task card system with detailed completion tracking

### System Improvements
- **Increased Resilience**: Automatic recovery from transient failures
- **Better Visibility**: Execution summaries provide clear task status
- **Clearer Patterns**: Well-documented orchestration protocols
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive retry and fallback test coverage

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run orchestrator with retry-enabled plan
python tools/arch_orchestrator.py plans/retry_fallback_example.yaml

# Generate execution summary
python tools/generate_execution_summary.py logs/orchestrator.log --format markdown -o summary.md
```

- CC (Claude Code): Core retry/fallback implementation, protocol documentation
- CA (Cursor AI): Testing framework and validation

# Release Notes - v1.0.0 Agent Core

## Project Purpose

The Agent Communication System (Agent OS) is a foundational infrastructure for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration through file-based message passing. This system enables autonomous agents to communicate, coordinate tasks, and execute workflows in a distributed environment.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Agent Orchestration
- Four specialized agents (CC, CA, WA, ARCH) work together through a standardized protocol
- File-based postbox system for asynchronous message passing
- JSON schema validation for message integrity

### 2. Message Routing
- Central router automatically distributes messages between agent inboxes
- Archive system for processed messages
- Schema-validated communication protocol

### 3. Task Management
- Interactive task injection via CLI
- Real-time monitoring of agent inboxes and outboxes
- Task status tracking and reporting

### 4. Development Infrastructure
- Simulation framework for testing agent behaviors
- End-to-end test harness for validation
- Agent self-initialization system

## Available Tools

1. **Agent Runner** (`agent_runner.py`)
   - Main CLI for agent task execution
   - Supports initialization, simulation, and clearing modes
   - Validates messages and updates task logs

2. **Task Dispatcher** (`tools/task_dispatcher.py`)
   - Interactive CLI for creating and injecting tasks
   - Automatic UUID generation and timestamping
   - Protocol-compliant message creation

3. **Inbox Monitor** (`tools/inbox_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time display of unread messages in agent inboxes
   - Support for all agents (CC, CA, WA, ARCH)
   - Message count statistics

4. **Flow Visualizer** (`tools/flow_visualizer.py`)
   - Terminal-based dashboard using curses
   - Real-time monitoring of all agent outboxes
   - Interactive message navigation

5. **Central Router** (`router/router.py`)
   - Automated message routing between agents
   - Batch processing with `--route` flag
   - Schema validation and error handling

## System Maturity Status

**Version 1.4.0 - Resilient Orchestration** - The system now includes robust task execution:
- ✅ Basic agent communication protocol
- ✅ File-based message passing
- ✅ Task injection and routing
- ✅ Monitoring and visualization tools
- ✅ Testing and simulation framework
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (Phase 4 Sprint 1)
- ✅ Fallback agent routing (Phase 4 Sprint 1)
- ✅ Execution summary generation (Phase 4 Sprint 1)
- ✅ Comprehensive orchestration protocol (Phase 4 Sprint 1)

## What's Next

### Phase 5: Web Interface and Advanced Features
- **Web Dashboard**: Modern UI for system monitoring and control
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live task tracking
- **Advanced Analytics**: Performance metrics and bottleneck analysis
- **Enhanced Security**: Authentication and access control

### Phase 6: Distributed Systems
