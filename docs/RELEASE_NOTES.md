# Release Notes - v1.0.0 Agent Core

## Project Purpose

The Agent Communication System (Agent OS) is a foundational infrastructure for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration through file-based message passing. This system enables autonomous agents to communicate, coordinate tasks, and execute workflows in a distributed environment.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Agent Orchestration
- Four specialized agents (CC, CA, WA, ARCH) work together through a standardized protocol
- File-based postbox system for asynchronous message passing
- JSON schema validation for message integrity

### 2. Message Routing
- Central router automatically distributes messages between agent inboxes
- Archive system for processed messages
- Schema-validated communication protocol

### 3. Task Management
- Interactive task injection via CLI
- Real-time monitoring of agent inboxes and outboxes
- Task status tracking and reporting

### 4. Development Infrastructure
- Simulation framework for testing agent behaviors
- End-to-end test harness for validation
- Agent self-initialization system

## Available Tools

1. **Agent Runner** (`agent_runner.py`)
   - Main CLI for agent task execution
   - Supports initialization, simulation, and clearing modes
   - Validates messages and updates task logs

2. **Task Dispatcher** (`tools/task_dispatcher.py`)
   - Interactive CLI for creating and injecting tasks
   - Automatic UUID generation and timestamping
   - Protocol-compliant message creation

3. **Inbox Monitor** (`tools/inbox_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time display of unread messages in agent inboxes
   - Support for all agents (CC, CA, WA, ARCH)
   - Message count statistics

4. **Flow Visualizer** (`tools/flow_visualizer.py`)
   - Terminal-based dashboard using curses
   - Real-time monitoring of all agent outboxes
   - Interactive message navigation

5. **Central Router** (`router/router.py`)
   - Automated message routing between agents
   - Batch processing with `--route` flag
   - Schema validation and error handling

## System Maturity Status

**MVP Core Achieved** - The foundational agent operating system is now operational with:
- ✅ Basic agent communication protocol
- ✅ File-based message passing
- ✅ Task injection and routing
- ✅ Monitoring and visualization tools
- ✅ Testing and simulation framework

## What's Next

### Phase 2: Enhanced Coordination
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed message deliveries
- **Status Tracking**: Centralized task progress monitoring across all agents
- **Task Dependencies**: Support for prerequisite tasks and complex workflows

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
- **Task Chaining**: Sequential and parallel task execution
- **Context Awareness**: Agents maintain conversation history
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent handling of failures

### Phase 4: Agent Autonomy
- **Self-directed Behavior**: Agents can initiate tasks independently
- **Learning System**: Pattern recognition for workflow optimization
- **Advanced UI**: Web dashboard for comprehensive system control

## Getting Started

```bash
# Initialize an agent
python agent_runner.py --agent CC --init

# Inject a task
./tools/task_dispatcher.py

# Monitor inboxes
python tools/inbox_monitor.py CC

# Route messages
python router/router.py --route

# Visualize message flow
python tools/flow_visualizer.py
```

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- File system with read/write permissions
- Terminal with curses support (for visualizer)
