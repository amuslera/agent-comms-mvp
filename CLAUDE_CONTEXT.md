# Claude Code Session Context

## Project Overview
Agent Communication MVP - Multi-agent system with DAG-based task execution and enhanced logging.

## Recent Work Completed
**TASK-090C: DAG-Aware Task Logger** ✅ COMPLETED
- Enhanced logging system with comprehensive DAG metadata
- State transition tracking with timestamps
- Central execution timeline logging
- MCP-compatible structured log formats
- Full schema validation and testing

**TASK-090A: DAG Plan Parser** ✅ COMPLETED  
- Comprehensive DAG data structures and algorithms
- Cycle detection using topological sorting
- JSON Schema validation for YAML plans

## Key Files Modified
- `/tools/arch/plan_utils.py` - Core DAG utilities and enhanced logging functions
- `/tools/arch/plan_runner.py` - DAG-aware execution engine with layer-by-layer processing
- `/schemas/TASK_LOG_SCHEMA.json` - Enhanced task log structure with DAG metadata
- `/schemas/EXECUTION_TRACE_SCHEMA.json` - Central execution timeline schema
- `/tests/test_dag_parser.py` - Comprehensive DAG functionality tests

## Current State
- All todos completed for TASK-090C
- System ready for production use with full DAG awareness
- Enhanced logging provides detailed execution metadata
- MCP compatibility maintained throughout

## Working Patterns Established
1. **Task Management**: Heavy use of TodoWrite/TodoRead for planning and tracking
2. **Testing Approach**: Comprehensive unit tests before implementation completion
3. **Schema Validation**: All logging structures validated against JSON schemas
4. **Documentation**: Task completion details documented in TASK_CARDS.md
5. **Code Style**: Dataclasses, type hints, comprehensive error handling

## Architecture Context
- Bluelabel Agent OS with 4 agents: ARCH, CA, CC, WA
- File-based postbox communication system
- YAML plan execution with DAG dependency resolution
- Enhanced logging for UI/CLI inspection capabilities

## Next Session Continuity
- No pending tasks from previous work
- System ready for new feature development or maintenance
- All core DAG and logging infrastructure complete
- Test suite provides comprehensive coverage for regression testing
