# TASK-043B: Live Test Report - Retry/Fallback Functionality

## Test Execution Summary

**Date**: 2025-05-18  
**Test Plan**: `plans/live_test_plan.yaml`  
**Branch**: `feat/TASK-043B-orchestrator-run`  

## Test Results

### Execution Flow

1. **Task 1: live-test-summary (CA → CC fallback)**
   - Initial agent: CA
   - Attempts with CA: 3 (all failed as designed)
   - Fallback to: CC (successful)
   - Total time: ~4 seconds

2. **Task 2: live-test-validate (WA)**
   - Executed successfully on first attempt
   - Dependent on Task 1 completion

3. **Task 3: live-test-notify (WA)**
   - Executed successfully on first attempt
   - Dependent on Task 2 completion

### Key Events

| Event Type | Count | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| RETRY | 2 | CA agent retried twice before exhausting attempts |
| FALLBACK | 1 | Successfully fell back from CA to CC |
| SUCCESS | 3 | All tasks eventually completed successfully |
| FAILURE | 3 | CA failed all 3 attempts as expected |

### Retry/Fallback Validation

✅ **FALLBACK TRIGGERED AS EXPECTED**
- Task `live-test-summary` failed 3 times with agent CA
- System correctly fell back to agent CC
- CC successfully completed the task
- Dependent tasks executed correctly after fallback success

### Log Highlights

```json
{"event": "FALLBACK", "task_id": "live-test-summary", "message": "Falling back from CA to CC"}
{"event": "FALLBACK_SUCCESS", "task_id": "live-test-summary", "message": "Task completed by fallback agent CC"}
```

## Test Verification

1. **Retry Logic**: ✅ Confirmed
   - CA attempted task 3 times (max_retries: 2)
   - Exponential backoff simulated with 2-second delays

2. **Fallback Logic**: ✅ Confirmed
   - After CA exhausted retries, system fell back to CC
   - CC successfully completed the task

3. **Dependency Handling**: ✅ Confirmed
   - Tasks 2 and 3 executed only after Task 1 succeeded via fallback

## Conclusion

The live test successfully demonstrated:
- Retry mechanism with configurable attempts
- Fallback routing to alternative agents
- Proper dependency chain execution
- Comprehensive event logging

The retry/fallback feature is working as designed and ready for production use.
